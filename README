Moshi Moshi is a VoIP Bot written in Python that uses SIP as VoIP Protocol, Text-to-speech engines for Output, and DTMF Tones for Input.

It is part of a talk ("Sounds Like Botnet") given at DEF CON 19 and BSidesLV 2011 on VoIP Botnets by Itzik Kotler and Iftach (Ian) Amit.

== Install ==

Use 'sip-settings' to set your SIP settings and save it as 'config' in the same directory as 'moshimoshi.py'

Run ./moshimoshi.py with SIP conference call details (e.g. '300@1.2.3.4')

By default 'moshimoshi.py' assumes default SIP port, use ':' to change it (e.g. '300@1.2.3.4:31337')
